                The <strong>Karanja Tree</strong> (<em>Pongamia pinnata (syn. Millettia pinnata)</em>), also known as 
                <strong>Karanj</strong> in Hindi. s a fast-growing, hardy tree native to India and Southeast Asia.
                 Belonging to the legume family (Fabaceae), it is well known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil,
                  making it valuable for improving soil fertility and rehabilitating degraded lands. The tree grows up to
                   20 meters tall and produces fragrant, purple-white flowers and flat seed pods containing oil-rich seeds.
                    Karanja oil, extracted from the seeds, is widely used in biofuel production, as well as in traditional
                     medicine for treating skin conditions. The tree is drought-tolerant, salt-resistant, and plays a vital 
                     role in agroforestry and erosion control. Due to its environmental benefits and economic value, it
                      is increasingly promoted for sustainable land management and renewable energy sources.
